# Goal
I want to build a website that will show me everything that I need to see and have access to.

## Inspiration
I currently use Obsidian to track everythig that I do as well as to keep notes about my day, how I'm feel, and general journaling.
I like how Obsidians UI, notes kept in MD files, and the ability to easily create links with brackets.

### Obsidian
In Obsidian I have a dashboard set up that shows me the following:
- A chart of how I am feeling for the day
- All active media that I am watching
- Helpful links
- Quick links to other media files such as list and monthly notes
- Links to other media files that have goals

### Homepage of a browser
When you first open a browser you are able to see links to things that you use all the time.
I also have so many saved sites that I forget that I have

### Excersice
I run most days of the week
I would like to see a tracker of how much progress that I have made in speed and distance.
I use Garmin to track my excersise.

### Smart home
- Integration with home assistant
- Or a link to view the home asistant dashboard

### Steam
Being able to see what I am currently playing

### Plex Serve
