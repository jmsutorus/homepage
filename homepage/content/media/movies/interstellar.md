# Interstellar

An epic space odyssey about humanity's search for a new home. Nolan combines hard science fiction with deeply emotional storytelling.

## Overview
Cooper, a former NASA pilot, leads a mission through a wormhole to find a habitable planet for humanity. The film explores time dilation, black holes, and the power of love across dimensions.

## Standout Moments
- The docking scene with dramatic music is incredibly tense
- Matthew McConaughey watching decades of messages from his kids
- The tesseract sequence inside the black hole
- TARS is one of the best AI characters in cinema

## Science
The depiction of the black hole Gargantua was created with actual physics simulations by Kip Thorne. The movie takes scientific accuracy seriously while still being emotionally resonant.

Absolutely stunning visually and emotionally. A must-watch on the biggest screen possible.
