# The Office

Currently rewatching this comfort show for the third time. The mockumentary style sitcom about Dunder Mifflin paper company never gets old.

## Current Progress
On Season 5 of my rewatch. The Jim and Pam storyline is still as charming as ever.

## Why It Works
- Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is simultaneously cringeworthy and lovable
- The documentary format allows for great talking head moments
- Strong ensemble cast with memorable side characters
- Perfect balance of humor and heart
- Loads of quotable lines

## Favorite Characters
1. Dwight Schrute - the beet farmer assistant (to the) regional manager
2. Michael Scott - world's best boss (according to his mug)
3. Jim Halpert - the pranks never get old
4. Pam Beesly - the heart of the show

Perfect background show for working or relaxing. So many iconic moments and quotes.
